# Decorators Exercise
This Python program demonstrates the use of decorators to create a sandwich-making process. 
It defines a decorator function cheese_and_buns that adds upper and lower bread to a sandwich. 
The program then decorates a chicken function with this decorator, creating a sandwich-making process with roasted chicken.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (sandwich_maker.py).
4. Run the program using a Python interpreter
5. The program will execute and display the output, showing the sandwich-making process.
### Example Output
I am upper bread
I am roasted chicken
I am lower bread
